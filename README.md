## Tell me about yourself 
I am a passionate and analytically minded individual with an aptitude for science and logical thinking. I have a great passion for learning and developing myself and my understanding of the world around me. I like to learn about a variety of scientific and technological subjects, and keep up to date on tech news and advancements. Other hobbies include cycling, personal wellbeing and art. 

## What has been the proudest moment of your life?
The proudest moment of my life is probably self-learning python for my initial Sparta academy application. When applying for the DevOps engineer course with spartaglobal I had no programming experience, despite having a good understanding of computers and generally a rich background of being surrounded by and interested in tech I still had never really tried to learn any coding languages. So in less than two weeks, I had to teach myself python from scratch while still working a full time job as a technical helpdesk advisor with another tech company. 
In attempting this I found that I could really push the limits of my ability to work hard after hours and also that it's a great exercise to practice effectively researching a topic which is something I enjoyed already. 
Although I struggled at times, I managed to build enough understanding of python to get full marks on the pre-interview assessment for the spartan academy
This meant I was able to choose from any sparta course that required a python assessment, which is something I never expected to qualify for as someone with no prior coding experience. It felt really rewarding to see a result which can sort of empirically validate my ability to learn quickly which is something I had always seen as one of my main strengths so I have to say I'm quite proud of this moment.

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is the merging of the development and operations departments with the aim of creating a more effective product delivery and maintenance system. 

### Why DevOps
DevOps was born out of a need for better teamwork and integration of the development and delivery/maintenance lifecycle. The primary goals of DevOps are to enhance communication between cross-functional teams and to deliver higher quality products faster. DevOps has many benefits, including but not limited to greatly improving teamwork and greatly reducing miscommunication between these critically important cross-functional teams which saves a lot of time for the company which in turn saves money.

## What is Agile & Scrum, how have you used them?
Agile is a project management methodology which is focused on more efficient and effective project development which consists of 4 main pillars. These are to prioritise individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over extensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and adapting to unexpected changes instead of strictly following a rigid plan.

Scrum is a framework of project management which falls under the agile umbrella term. The three key artefacts of Scrum are the increment, the product backlog, and the sprint backlog. One of the most useful elements of this framework is the daily scrum meetings that are held to make sure everyone on the team is on the same page about progress and to establish any potential blockers anyone might have. This greatly enhances team communication and transparency. Other key practices include creating sprint backlogs, organising the project backlog, and the sprint review.

During my sparta academy training we used scrum on a daily basis and to organise all of our learning and team projects. We engage in daily scrum standup meetings and use weekly sprints to ensure consistent progress. From my experience with scrum I'd have to say I find it very useful for providing a good structure and for resolving issues before they can cause more severe problems.
